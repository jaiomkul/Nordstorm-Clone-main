# Nordstorm-Clone-main
Nordstrom, Inc. is an American luxury department store chain. Founded in 1901 by John W. Nordstrom and Carl F. Wallin, it originated as a shoe store and evolved into a full-line retailer with departments for clothing, footwear, handbags, jewelry, accessories, cosmetics, and fragrances. 

As a part of our build week we were given a problem statement to clone the website Nordstrom. We have tried to make a pixel-perfect clone of the original website in 6 days.
